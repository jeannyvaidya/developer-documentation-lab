# Developer Documentation Lab

Practice using Developer Documentation to find answers to problems you encounter!

## Properly Asking for Help (30 minutes)

- Register for both a [GAQA](http://gaqa.herokuapp.com/) and **Stack Overflow** account
- Fill out your Stack Overflow profile details with as much detail as possible
- In a group, use developer documentation to research `ArrayList`
- Learn how to **add**, **find**, and **remove** elements within an ArrayList
- The first time you run into a problem, browse to GAQA
- Review the contents of [Stack Overflow's 'How do I ask a good question?'](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)
- Peer review your question with others to verify that they can understand what you are asking
- Post your question to GAQA! Feel free to browse other student's questions as they are posted

> ***Next***: Once every group has posted a question online, move to the next section.

## Answering Questions (20 Minutes)

- Everyone as a class should review the questions that other students have posted
- Your instructor will assign one question to each group
- You have 15 minutes to research and resolve the problem
- Provide an answer on GAQA within these 20 minutes

**Bonus:**
- Answer other student's questions than the one your were assigned!

## Stack Overflow (30 minutes)

- In the past week, you have likely run into a problem
- Brainstorm common problems that you and your groupmates have encountered
- Research them on Stack Overflow
- Upvote answers and comments that you find helpful or insightful
- Once you've completed this, it is time for you to learn something _new_ again!
- Research the `StringBuilder` class and use it to create a `String`.
- StringBuilder is designed to build strings; instead of having to _concatenate by hand_, you can use this instead.
- _When_ you run into a problem, you should use documentation to aid you!
- **If** you find that you have a _unique_ question, **you should post it!**
- **Otherwise** feel free to comment and upvote answers that you find helpful!

**Bonus:**
- Complete an application as a that uses StringBuilder!
- Deploy it on Github!

## Wrap Up

- Ask questions! Let's get everything out. 
- What hurt? What felt great?
- What was the largest takeaway for you from this lab?
